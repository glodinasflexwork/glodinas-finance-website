            <h3>Home Office Deduction</h3>
            <p>
              If you work from home, you may be able to deduct a portion of your housing costs as business expenses.

              <li>The workspace must be an essential part of your business operations</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Deductible Expenses:</h4>
            <p>
              If you meet the requirements, you can deduct a proportional part of:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mortgage interest or rent</li>
              <li>Property taxes</li>
              <li>Home insurance</li>

            </ul>
            
            <p>
              The deductible portion is typically calculated based on the square footage of your workspace relative to the total living area.
            </p>
            
            <h3>External Workspace Deduction</h3>
            <p>
              If you rent an external office, coworking space, or other business premises, the full cost is generally deductible as a business expense.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Vehicle and Transportation Deductions</h2>
            
            <h3>Business Vehicle Deductions</h3>
            <p>
              If you use a vehicle for business purposes, you have two options for tax deductions:
            </p>
            
            <h4>Option 1: Actual Cost Method</h4>
            <p>
              Deduct the actual business portion of all vehicle expenses, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fuel</li>
              <li>Insurance</li>
              <li>Maintenance and repairs</li>
              <li>Road tax (motorrijtuigenbelasting)</li>
              <li>Depreciation</li>
              <li>Financing costs</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              You must keep detailed records of business versus personal use and can only deduct the business percentage.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Option 2: Standard Mileage Deduction</h4>
            <p>
              Alternatively, you can use a standard rate of €0.21 per kilometer for business travel. This simplifies record-keeping but may result in a lower deduction than the actual cost method.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Public Transportation and Other Travel</h3>
            <p>
